Rosealee is the widow of his best friend, and, for a variety of reasons, both she and Joseph are reluctant to set a date (she devotes much of her time to caring for her ailing mother). One day Joseph is met in his barn by Catherine Wheeler (Amy Locane \"Secretary,\" \"Cry-Baby\"), a new student in his senior class, Catherine attempts to seduce Joseph, who dutifully refuses, only to request a second chance a few moments later, which Catherine eagerly grants him. This unexpected event brings out a newly adventurous side in Joseph, though he suddenly has a new set of complications to go along with it; he discovers that his school is closing, and Catherines parents are predictably angry when they find out about their daughters liaison."},{"wrapperType":"track","kind":"feature-movie","artistId":63399334,"trackId":674861323,"artistName":"Carrie Underwood","trackName":"Carrie Underwood: The Blown Away Tour - LIVE","trackCensoredName":"Carrie Underwood: The Blown Away Tour - LIVE","artistViewUrl":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/carrie-underwood/63399334?uo=4","trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/carrie-underwood-the-blown-away-tour-live/id674861323?uo=4","previewUrl":"https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video127/v4/64/c3/6f/64c36f8d-5602-4f45-72c2-9443387ec43d/mzvf_9008091153927611846.640x478.h264lc.U.p.m4v","artworkUrl30":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video5/v4/d6/f1/d1/d6f1d1e1-f4c9-3c32-ff9e-61182ced6c2e/source/30x30bb.jpg","artworkUrl60":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video5/v4/d6/f1/d1/d6f1d1e1-f4c9-3c32-ff9e-61182ced6c2e/source/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video5/v4/d6/f1/d1/d6f1d1e1-f4c9-3c32-ff9e-61182ced6c2e/source/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":12.99,"trackPrice":12.99,"collectionHdPrice":15.99,"trackHdPrice":15.99,"releaseDate":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackTimeMillis":7194720,"country":"USA","currency":"USD","primaryGenreName":"Concert Films","contentAdvisoryRating":"NR","shortDescription":"Pollstar’s Top Female Country Touring Artist of 2012, and six-time GRAMMY® winner Carrie Underwood","longDescription":"Pollstar’s Top Female Country Touring Artist of 2012, and six-time GRAMMY® winner Carrie Underwood now brings the magic of her sold-out “Blown Away Tour” to video with the release of The Blown Away Tour: LIVE. Filmed in concert in March 2013 in Ontario, California, The Blown Away Tour: LIVE features more than 20 songs, with performances of Carrie’s #1 singles, including such favorites as “Before He Cheats,” “Two Black Cadillacs,” and the album title track that inspired her tour name, “Blown Away.”  The live concert was directed by Christian Lamb and produced by Domenic Potter. Alongside nearly 100 minutes of performance footage will be exclusive bonus clips offering a behind-the-scenes look into the making of the tour, including interviews with Carrie and Raj Kapoor, the tour director responsible for the large production and effects that defined the visual elements of “The Blown Away Tour.” Exclusive bonus clips were produced and directed by Todd Cassetty.  A photo gallery is also included. Carrie’s remarkable “Blown Away Tour” launched in the spring of 2012 and continued through May 23, 2013, for a total of 112 dates in 110 cities, six countries, and three continents, playing for more than 1,000,000 fans and selling out every concert this year. By the numbers, the state-of-the-art stage production for the “Blown Away Tour” included 575,424 individual LED lights in 3,000 square feet of video walls and an incredible 23,063 feet of cable to generate the 172 different colors used in the show’s lighting.  As part of each show, Carrie and her band flew 150 feet above the audience on a secondary stage that weighed 5,890 pounds, while CO2 and Nitrogen tanks were used during the life of the tour to create the “Blown Away” tornado effect at each performance. Since releasing her debut album in 2005, Carrie Underwood has sold over 15 million albums and charted 17 #1 singles, eight of which she co-wrote."},{"wrapperType":"track","kind":"feature-movie","trackId":1068031533,"artistName":"Mikel Rueda","trackName":"Hidden Away","trackCensoredName":"Hidden Away","trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/hidden-away/id1068031533?uo=4","previewUrl":"https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video111/v4/a2/da/de/a2dade1c-2180-8024-144a-efd4d392839c/mzvf_9032182287536053607.640x356.h264lc.U.p.m4v","artworkUrl30":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video7/v4/e9/4b/b5/e94bb54f-c763-1f4d-6357-f0e9acd92f2f/source/30x30bb.jpg","artworkUrl60":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video7/v4/e9/4b/b5/e94bb54f-c763-1f4d-6357-f0e9acd92f2f/source/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video7/v4/e9/4b/b5/e94bb54f-c763-1f4d-6357-f0e9acd92f2f/source/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":7.99,"trackPrice":7.99,"trackRentalPrice":3.99,"collectionHdPrice":9.99,"trackHdPrice":9.99,"trackHdRentalPrice":3.99,"releaseDate":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackTimeMillis":5514250,"country":"USA","currency":"USD","primaryGenreName":"Drama","contentAdvisoryRating":"Unrated","shortDescription":"In the bathroom of a crowded nightclub, Ibrahim, a 14-year old Moroccan boy, crosses paths with","longDescription":"In the bathroom of a crowded nightclub, Ibrahim, a 14-year old Moroccan boy, crosses paths with Spanish teen Rafa.

WINTER, GO AWAY! was filmed by the graduates of Marina Razbezhkina and Mikhail Ugarov's Documentary Filmmaking and Theater School. Ten young directors did not part from their cameras for two months. The result was a chronicle of Russia's winter protests - a chronicle of those who make the political climate and those who are dissatisfied with the makers. We see people, their faces, their conversations, rallies, victories and defeats ahead of the presidential election. A living camera interacts with living heroes. WINTER, GO AWAY! is funny in places - and yet contains an overall sadness: A unique account of Russia today."},{"wrapperType":"track","kind":"feature-movie","trackId":1201631258,"artistName":"Dave Osborne","trackName":"Friends and Heroes Bible Adventures: Vol. 4, The One That Got Away/Doing Our Part","trackCensoredName":"Friends and Heroes Bible Adventures: Vol. 4, The One That Got Away/Doing Our Part","trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/friends-and-heroes-bible-adventures-vol-4-the-one/id1201631258?uo=4","previewUrl":"https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video111/v4/d5/87/f8/d587f8d5-b895-0770-85fc-12851db39651/mzvf_3735055593263704767.640x480.h264lc.U.p.m4v","artworkUrl30":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video51/v4/97/0b/95/970b95da-a8cd-7ef2-f4ef-d0d7d3567b6d/source/30x30bb.jpg","artworkUrl60":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video51/v4/97/0b/95/970b95da-a8cd-7ef2-f4ef-d0d7d3567b6d/source/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video51/v4/97/0b/95/970b95da-a8cd-7ef2-f4ef-d0d7d3567b6d/source/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":10.99,"trackPrice":10.99,"trackRentalPrice":4.99,"releaseDate":"2007-10-01T07:00:00Z","collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackTimeMillis":2958522,"country":"USA","currency":"USD","primaryGenreName":"Kids & Family","contentAdvisoryRating":"Unrated","shortDescription":"The Bible comes alive for children and the whole family!

In Part 2, Doing Our Part, it’s Purim time, and while Macky, Sollie and the kids act out the story of brave Queen Esther, Diana too shows courage as she tries to lead destitute refugees through the dangerous streets, and recounts the tale of Joseph of Cyprus (Barnabas) to her Roman jailor.
