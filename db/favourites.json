But a chain of grisly killings has cast a bloody pall of uncertainty over its residents, especially Josuke Higashikata, a high schooler with offbeat hair and even more eccentric abilities. Now, with his grandfather on Morioh's homicide list, Josuke must resort to his surreal \"\"Stand\"\" powers if he ever hopes to heal his beloved family and town. Josuke may have a Stand-wielding relative at his side, but the killer has plenty of help too."},{"wrapperType":"track","kind":"feature-movie","trackId":314916514,"artistName":"David Miller","trackName":"Executive Action","trackCensoredName":"Executive Action","trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/executive-action/id314916514?uo=4","previewUrl":"https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video113/v4/a7/20/00/a720004f-65fe-2072-eaf4-0bc1219eb4dd/mzvf_1642275559788931427.640x480.h264lc.U.p.m4v","artworkUrl30":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/v4/5e/a1/7d/5ea17dd2-b37b-1f2e-0c86-e80838d2b7b7/source/30x30bb.jpg","artworkUrl60":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/v4/5e/a1/7d/5ea17dd2-b37b-1f2e-0c86-e80838d2b7b7/source/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/v4/5e/a1/7d/5ea17dd2-b37b-1f2e-0c86-e80838d2b7b7/source/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":4.99,"trackPrice":4.99,"trackRentalPrice":2.99,"collectionHdPrice":4.99,"trackHdPrice":4.99,"trackHdRentalPrice":2.99,"releaseDate":"1973-11-07T08:00:00Z","collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackTimeMillis":5439063,"country":"USA","currency":"USD","primaryGenreName":"Drama","contentAdvisoryRating":"PG","longDescription":"Screen legend Burt Lancaster stars in this fictional account of a plot against President Kennedy by a powerful group of political\r\nconspirators who object to his foreign and domestic policies as a threat to their control of the economy.
